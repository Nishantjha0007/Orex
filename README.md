# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System

A smart dashboard that uses simulated IoT sensor data and AI models to predict equipment failure in industrial robots.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of robot temperature, vibration, and load  
- AI-based failure probability scoring  
- Automatic status updates (Operational, Warning, Critical)  
- Maintenance task generation and alerts  
- Interactive control buttons and responsive design  

## Simulation
Uses JavaScript to mimic live IoT data updates and calculate failure probabilities.  
UI dynamically refreshes without page reload, showing live robot health and performance.

## Purpose
Prototype for demonstrating how AI can prevent unexpected downtime by enabling predictive and proactive maintenance.
